//from the specs
//    Populates the server's database with generated data for the specified username.
//        The required "username" parameter must be a user already registered with the server.
//        If there is any data in the database already associated with the given username, it is deleted.
//        The optional "generations" parameter lets the caller specify the number of generations of ancestors to be generated, and must be a non-negative integer
//        (the default is 4, which results in 31 new persons each with associated events).
